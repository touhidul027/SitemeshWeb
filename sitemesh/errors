errors :
E1 - Nothing specific but shown cross sign on project root.
-----------------------------------------------------------
For me, this happens with Maven and Eclipse/STS whenever I update my IDE 
or import an existing Maven project. Go to the "Problems tab" 
(Window -> Show View -> Problems) and see what it says. Recently, the 
problems tab showed Project configuration is not up-to-date ... and 
suggested that I use Maven to update my project configuration, and 
this solved the "red X" problem. To do this, in the "Project Explorer" 
view, trigger the context menu and select 
Maven -> Update Project, as seen in this screenshot snippet:
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Cannot change version of project facet Dynamic Web Module to 4.0.	sitemesh		line 1	Maven Java EE Configuration Problem

same the model version of <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> to dynamic 
module from project facets.
